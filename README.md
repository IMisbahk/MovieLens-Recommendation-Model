# Movie Recommendation System  

This project builds a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. The system provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and ratings, leveraging machine learning techniques like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.  

## Objectives  
1. Understand the fundamentals of recommendation systems.  
2. Explore and preprocess the MovieLens dataset.  
3. Implement content-based filtering and collaborative filtering algorithms.  
4. Evaluate the system using appropriate metrics.  
5. Optionally create a simple user interface for recommendations.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is the [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), a popular dataset for building and evaluating recommendation systems. It contains the following key files:  
- **movies.csv**: Information about movies (titles and genres).  
- **ratings.csv**: User ratings for movies.  
- **tags.csv**: User-provided tags for movies (optional).  

## Key Features  
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on their features (e.g., genres).  
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies based on user preferences and behaviors.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Metrics like RMSE and Precision@K are used to evaluate the system.  

## Steps to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository.  
2. Download the MovieLens dataset   
3. Install required Python libraries.  

4. Follow the step-by-step implementation in the notebooks or scripts.  

## Tools and Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.  
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.  
- **Scikit-Learn**: For similarity calculations and model evaluation.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.  
- **Streamlit/Flask** (optional): For building a simple user interface.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Combine content-based and collaborative filtering for a hybrid approach.  
- Use advanced techniques like neural collaborative filtering or deep learning.  
- Expand the system to include sentiment analysis for user reviews.
